                    London Independent Drivers Organisation(LIMDO) is an association formed in November 2019
                    to provide for the interest of all licenced PCO drivers by Transport for London.
                    We are growing in numbers and our support for the welfare and betterment of mini cab drivers is commendable.
                </h6>


                <p>
                    On the 3rd of December 2019, we wrote to the Mayor of London to remove congestion charge since it causing
                    finacial hardship on numbers of drivers. In reply it was made known that TFL conducted a consultation exercise prior
                    to the enforcement where only 10,000 responses were received with a majority of those (not mini cab drivers) in
                    support of imposing congestion charge on minicab drivers. We as licenned drivers were not personally consulted by TFl. Our
                    next task is to get over 10,000 drivers sign a petition to exempt minicab drivers from congestion charge.
                </p>

                <p>On the 27 of March 2019, we wrote to the Mayor of London on behalf of minicab drivers requesting for the followings </p>
                <p>Suspension of congestion charge because of the impact of COVID-19 on minicab drivers</p>
                <p>
                    Guidelines to support minicab drivers whose licence and MOT checks were due to expire as result
                    of the closure of TFL offices and MOT centres.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Few day later, following our letter, the Mayor's office complied with our request and suggestions made in letter by extending
                    all licences and vehicle MOT due to expire by six months and suspension of congestion charge due to COVID-19
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-warning">Our Aim</h4>
                <h6>With over 114,000 licenced minicab divers by Transport for London our aim is to:</h6>
                <p>- To bring togetherness among minicab drives in order to tailor our uniform interest under one umbrella.</p>
                <p>- To liaise with TFL in formulating policies for London Minicab Industry.</p>
                <p>- To prevent finacial hardship on minicab drivers resulting from TFL policies</p>
                <p>-To work with TFL and minicab Operators to sanitize London's Minicab Industry for public safety.</p>
                <p>-To advocate on behalf of minicab driver whose is just been suspended from taking job due to compliant raised by passenger </p>
                <p>- To liaise withinsuranse companies for cheaper insurance for licenced minicab drivers</p>

                <h6>Together we can request for better conditions from TFL.</h6>
                <h6>United we can also  protect minicab industry from criminal elements. There is strength in unity</h6>
